# Spare Homebrew casks

This repository serves as a tap for a handful of programs I use that don't (yet)
have Homebrew-official casks. They may be useful to others, or they may not.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install bsoyka/extras/<formula>`

Or `brew tap bsoyka/extras` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "bsoyka/extras"
brew "<formula>"
```
